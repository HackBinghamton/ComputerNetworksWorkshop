# Computer Networks Workshop

## Getting Started

In this brand-new workshop, we'll be learning how to write code that can communicate with other computers over the internet, as well as how some of the internet works! We'll discuss everything from socket programming, to the infrastructure of the Internet Protocol (IP), to some of the intricacies of application-layer protocols like HTTP.

No worries if none of that sounds familiar -- the only requirement coming into this workshop is a decent understanding of Python.

## Sections

* **[Intro to Socket Programming](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/ComputerNetworksWorkshop/blob/main/intro-sockets/introduction-to-socket-programming.ipynb)** - 
How to use sockets, the building blocks of internet-enabled programs!
* **[The TCP/IP Stack and Transport-Layer Protocols](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/ComputerNetworksWorkshop/blob/main/tcp-ip-stack-and-transport.ipynb)** - 
An overview of the structure of the internet, and how to choose the right kind of socket for your application!
* **[IP Addresses and DNS](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/ComputerNetworksWorkshop/blob/main/ip-addresses-dns.ipynb)** -
A discussion of how computers know how to find one another (and when they can't), as well as how we connect domain names to IP addresses!
* **[Application-Layer Protocols](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/ComputerNetworksWorkshop/blob/main/application-layer.ipynb)** -
How application-layer protocols work, with HTTP as a case study!
