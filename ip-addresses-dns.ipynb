    "# IP Addresses and NAT\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "In this section, you'll learn\n",
    "1. What IP addresses mean and how they're built\n",
    "2. What NAT is and how it works\n",
    "3. What DNS is and how to work with it with sockets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting this section, you should have an understanding of\n",
    "1. [Socket Programming](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Up to this point, we've only discussed how to run networked programs on `localhost` or our local networks -- it's important to understand how the internet is structured, and what might keep up from connecting to other computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've noted previously, an IP address is a number that identifies a computer (a 32-bit integer often represented by the `###.###.###.###` format where each number is <256).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fairly simple concept, but there are several features of networks and addresses to keep track of, like Network Address Translation (NAT) and special-use IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal and find your *local* IP address -- that is, the one that starts with `192.168`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Windows/MacOS: Use the `ipconfig` command\n",
    "* Linux: Use the `ip addr` command\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, find your *global* IP address. You can do this by simple looking up \"what is my IP\" on Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that you got *two different addresses*! Why are they different? How can one computer have multiple addresses? Let's look into it!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Address Translation (NAT)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** This might get a little confusing at first, but we'll work through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem: Multiple IP Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Local IP Addresses\n",
    "Let's talk about that `192.168` address that you found before. This is your \"local\" IP address, and **it's only accessible to other computers on your network, and your router**! Your router is responsible for giving you this address when you first connect to your Wi-Fi.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you just want to connect to other computers on your local network, then using local IP addresses will work totally fine! However, if I tell you that my IP address is `192.168.68.109` (which it actually is at the time of writing), you couldn't connect to me if you wanted to! That's because your router would simply look for that address on *your* home network.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Global IP Addresses\n",
    "You might assume that the global IP is your computer's publicly-routable IP address that the whole world can see, but it's not quite that -- **it's your *router's* global address**!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try getting your global IP address from another device, like your phone, you'll notice that it gives you the same IP address. That's because your phone is connected to the same router!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Solution: IP Address Translation\n",
    "So, how do we connect out to the rest of the internet when the internet can't see our computers? Your router uses NAT to ***translate*** your local IP address to the router's globally-accessible IP address, and keeps track of what traffic belongs to your computer versus other computers on the network!\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the internet looks more like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![NAT Diagram](nat.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implications of NAT\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that *if you try to host a server on your computer, it won't be visible to the rest of the world*!\n",
    "\n",
    "* If someone tries to connect to you with your **router's address**, your router won't know where to send the traffic on the local network.\n",
    "* If someone tries to connect to you with your **local address**, they'll actually be connecting to a different computer on their own Wi-Fi!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there area a few solutions to this problem:\n",
    "* Running the server on your router (not recommended)\n",
    "* Using port forwarding (still not recommended)\n",
    "* Hosting with a cloud provider like AWS (**much better**)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special-Use IP Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "IP addresses may all look the same in format, but there are a certain few varieties of IP addresses to keep in mind when doing network-related things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `0.0.0.0` - Used when hosting a server to the local network\n",
    "* `10.###.###.###` - Used for private networks like VPNs\n",
    "* `127.###.###.###` - Localhost addresses private to every computer\n",
    "* `192.168.###.###` - Local network IP addresses (like in your home network)\n",
    "* `255.255.255.255` - \"Broadcast\" IP address for UDP -- using this as a destination will send to every computer on your network!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more addresses like these as specified at the [IPv4 wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Special-use_addresses).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Domain Name System (DNS)\n",
    "\n",
    "You've probably noticed that IP addresses aren't really what we type when browsing to websites. DNS allows us to attach domain names (e.g. `google.com`) to an IP address!\n",
    "\n",
    "When you browse to a website, your browser doesn't initially know the IP address that goes with the domain name -- it has to send a **DNS request** to find it! This request makes its way through a series of servers, and eventually you'll be sent a response that contains the IP address of the place you asked for!\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't get into the details of how DNS works, but we'll see how we can work with it with sockets!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with DNS with Sockets\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a function in the `socket` library called `socket.gethostbyname()` that takes a hostname and returns its IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the IP address of `amazon.com`."
